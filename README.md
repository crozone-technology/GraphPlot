## ✨ Features

- 📂 Upload a graph image (.png, .jpg)
- 📐 Calibrate the X and Y axes by selecting known points and inputting real values
- 📍 Plot data points manually on the graph to get true coordinates
- ➕ Draw assist lines (X or Y) for visual reference
- 💾 Save/load entire project (image + points + axis config)
- ⏪ Undo / Redo point plotting
- 🔍 Zoom in/out and Pan view with mouse
- 🧭 Friendly UI with log tracking and mode indicators

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Upload Graph Image**  
   Click `📂 Upload Graph Image` and choose your file.

2. **Configure Axis**  
   - Click `1️⃣ Configure X` → click 2 or more points on the X-axis and enter their real values  
   - Click `2️⃣ Configure Y` → repeat for Y-axis

3. **Plot Points**  
   - Click `3️⃣ Plot Graph`  
   - Click points along the curve — results will appear below (including real-world mapped values)

4. **Draw Reference Line**  
   - Select axis (`draw on X-Axis` or `Y-Axis`)  
   - Enter value → click `➕ Draw`

5. **Save or Reload Project**
